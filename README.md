Planar Shadows and Shadow Mapping homework assignment from Computer Graphics at Texas A&amp;M (fall 2023)
As a exercise for myself I did a homework assignment from the Computer Graphics class offered at Texas A&M that I didn't do when I was taking the class.

The program renders the scene using planar shadows and shadow mapping. To toggle between them use 's'.
    The shadow map generated is shown at the bottom right corner.
The light in the scene can be moved around
      'x'/'X' translates it along the x axis
      'y'/'Y' translates it along the y axis
      'z'/'Z' translates it along the z axis
      'r' resets the position of the light

'q' to quit
